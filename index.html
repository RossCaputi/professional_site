            <p>I'm a scholar, educator, and PhD student of history at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I focus in modern American, Italian, and European history with specific interests in the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq and the social history of the Italian south. I have a background in linguistics and oral history, and I'm interested in using digital tools to make my research avialable to a wider audience. Most of all I'm passionate about public engagement and creating resources and knowledge that will be useful and available to vulnerable communities.</p>
            <p>Through my research on the Iraq War, I've done a fine grained study on the conflict in Fallujah, looking at the workings of US information operations and the nature of the Fallujan civil and military resistance. Some of the questions that come out of this research are: How do we evaluate military actions that take place in an abstract "battle space," including the tradition battle field plus the information relm, and that have political, rhetorical, as well as military objectives? How do historians take account of the spin of information warfare and establish fact and narrative?</p>
            <p>My researh in Italy is based in the village of Grumento Nova, Basilicata. This project combines methods form langauge documentation, historical sociolinguistics, and social history in an attempt to combine a public history project focused on documenting this towns language &#40;called <i>Saponarese</i>&#41; with an analysis of the town's social history. Many of the major social transformations this town has undergone in the last 100 years are reflected in the language, which has been mixed with standard Italian in revealing ways. My thesis is that this language a social fabric that holds this town together as a community, and that by using linguistics as a prysm into this town's social history offers a more intimate look into the felt experiences of social change. </p>

            <p>I'm the main author of <i>The Sacking of Fallujah: A People's History</i> &#40;2019&#41;. This book is the first comprehensive study of the three recent sieges of this city, including those by the United States in 2004 and the Iraqi-led operation to defeat ISIS in 2016. Unlike dominant military accounts that focus on American soldiers and U.S. leaders and perpetuate the myth that the United States “liberated” the city, this book argues that Fallujah was destroyed by coalition forces, leaving public health crises, political destabilization, and mass civilian casualties in their wake. This meticulously researched account cuts through the propaganda to uncover the lived experiences of Fallujans under siege and occupation, and contextualizes these events within a broader history of U.S. policy in the Middle East. </p>

            <p>I'm the curator of <i>A People's History of Fallujah Digital Archive</i>. This project is dedicated to providing the public with a people's history of the sieges of Fallujah as an act of reparations for the United State's role in destroying the city in 2004 and again in 2016. We seek to collect and create documentation of this conflict, address and transform the underlying causes, and repair the harm done to the extent that we are capable.</p>

            <h2>Public History</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working on a public history project in the Italian village of Grumento Nova. Like many small Italian villages, Grumento Nova has it's own language. This project is a mixture of language documentation, historical sociolinguistics, and social history. I'm working to document this language, called <i>Saponarese</i>, and to investigate this communities history through the prism of language change.  </p>
